    <!-- 1. The directive ng-model registers a keydown listener with the input field. 
            When the input field text changes a keydown event is fired and the 
        corresponding
            listener is called to handle it.
         2. Inside the keydown listener the directive assigns the new value of input
         field to the
           scope model specified in ng-model.
         In our case the model name is updated
            with the new value. This code is wrapped inside $apply() call
         3.After $apply() ends the digest cycle starts in which the watchers are called.
         If you have an expression {{name}} in the view it has already set up a 
        watcher on
           scope model name. So, in digest cycle this watcher gets called and 
        the listener function executes with the newValue and oldValue as arguments.
         The job of this
           listener is to update the DOM with the newValue probably using innerHTML
         4. The overall result is that you see the {{name}} updated with 
        whatever you type into the input field instantly
        -->

    <!-- $scope={name:value}-->
    <input id="input" type="text" ng-model="name" />
    <!-- One Way Binding -->
    <div id="output">{{name}}</div>
